## In this repository, I have included some of my work related implementation fuzzy logic and neural network systems from scratch for in-depth learning ##

- Developing a Fuzzy Logic System in Python to cluster social media
 posts based on their expressed sentiment.

- Implementing a multi-layer perception model(MLP) from scratch for
 binary classification. It was intended for classifying images of
 handwritten digits. (MINST dataset) 

- Building a Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) model to suggest
 autocompletion of half-typed words using the PyTorch library.

- Implementing a convolutional layer and pooling layer from scratch
 and using the Keras library to implement a CNN to classify images on
 the [CIFAR10 dataset]

 - Tech stack used: Python | numPy | PyTorch | Tensorflow | Keras
